## Daily R&D Report - 2025-08-09

### Completed Tasks
- Hardened PATCH/DELETE for /api/db/words/[id]:
  - Fixed Next.js route params typing (removed Promise usage)
  - Added Zod validation and sanitation for request body
  - Ensured selectedMeaning is part of meanings

### Discoveries
- Several API routes parse request bodies without schema validation.
- No testing setup detected (no jest/vitest/playwright) in package.json.
- Rate limiting and basic security headers are not centralized.

### Metrics
- Build/lint: PASS (local static check for edited file)
- Bugs fixed: 1 (params misuse)
- Endpoints hardened: 1

### Tomorrow's Priority
1. Add a lightweight validation utility (Zod) across API routes.
2. Introduce minimal test harness (Vitest) and add tests for words routes.
3. Add shared helpers for auth token extraction and error responses.
4. Consider rate limiting middleware for write endpoints.
