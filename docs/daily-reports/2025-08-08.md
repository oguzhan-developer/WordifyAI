## Daily R&D Report - 2025-08-08

### Completed Tasks
- **Fixed Critical TypeScript Errors:** Resolved all TypeScript errors that were preventing the project from building successfully. This involved correcting types in 6 different API route handlers.
- **Resolved Security Vulnerabilities:** Identified and fixed 3 low-severity security vulnerabilities related to the `cookie` package by updating dependencies.
- **Implemented Real Speech Recognition:** Replaced the mock speech recognition service in the pronunciation analysis feature with a real implementation using Google's Speech-to-Text API. This is controlled by a `USE_REAL_SPEECH_RECOGNITION` feature flag.
- **Established Testing Infrastructure:** Set up the Jest testing framework from scratch, including configuration, setup files, and necessary dependencies.
- **Added Initial Test Coverage:** Wrote the first tests for the project, covering the new speech recognition feature with 3 test cases for both the real and mock implementations.

### Discoveries
- The project was missing a configured linter (ESLint).
- The project had no existing test files or test coverage.
- There are several dependency conflicts with React 19 (e.g., `@testing-library/react`), requiring the use of `--legacy-peer-deps`.

### Metrics
- **Code Coverage:** Increased from 0% to providing initial test coverage for the `pronunciation-check` API endpoint.
- **Bugs Fixed:** All build-time type errors that were causing the `postinstall` script to fail.
- **Security Vulnerabilities Fixed:** 3.
- **Features Added:** 1 (Real Speech Recognition).

### Tomorrow's Priority
1. Request a code review for the new feature and the testing setup.
2. Address the outstanding technical debt, including the ESLint configuration and the React 19 dependency conflicts.
3. Begin the next cycle of the autonomous R&D process.
